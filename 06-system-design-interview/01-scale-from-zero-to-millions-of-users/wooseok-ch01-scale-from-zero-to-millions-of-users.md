# Single server setup 
## How http request traffic flows
- DNS query -> ip address returned -> http request is send to web server -> web server returns html page.

# Database
- Two tiers: web server and DB
- Types
  - RDBMS
  - NOSQL

### Ex. Attribute table

#### Products Table:

| ProductID | ProductName |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | T-shirt     |
| 2         | Jeans       |

#### Attributes Table:

| ProductID | AttributeName | AttributeValue |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| 1         | Color         | Red            |
| 1         | Size          | M              |
| 2         | Color         | Blue           |
| 2         | Size          | L              |

SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, MAX(CASE WHEN a.AttributeName = 'Color' THEN a.AttributeValue END) AS Color, MAX(CASE WHEN a.AttributeName = 'Size' THEN a.AttributeValue END) AS Size 
FROM Products p LEFT JOIN Attributes a ON p.ProductID = a.ProductID GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName;


Scaling
  - Vertical
    - Pros: simple
    - Cons: hard limit, no failover, no redundancy
  - Horizontal: 
    - Pros: failover, redundancy
    - Cons: complex

# Load balancer
- Web server is located behind load balancer
- client can't access web server directly

# Database replication
- Setup
  - Master: write
  - Slave: replicates master, read
- Advantages: performance, reliability, availability
- Fail over
  - Slave goes offline, read will be redirected to the next slave or master
  - Master goes offline, slave will be promoted to master and performs all DB operations until a new slave is ready

# Cache
- It is a temporary data store layer.
- Few considerations
  - Frequent read, not for persisting data
  - Expiration
  - Consistency
  - Mitigating failures: avoid SPOF
  - Eviction policy: LRU
- https://codeahoy.com/2017/08/11/caching-strategies-and-how-to-choose-the-right-one/

# CDN
- static content like images, css, js
- Few considerations
  - Cost: cache frequently used data
  - Cache expiry
  - Fallback for failure
  - Invalidating files

# Stateless web tier
- Move out session data from web server to persistent data store

# Data centers
- Technical challenges of multi data centers
  - Traffic redirection
  - Data sync
  - Test and deployment

# Message queue
- Producer and consumer
- Async

# Logging, metrics, automation
- Logging: Tools to aggregate logs to a centralized service
- Metrics
  - Host level: CPU, Memory, Disk I/O
  - Aggregated level: Performance of DB / Cache tier
  - Business metrics: DAU, retention, etc
- Automation
  - Ci/CD, dev env automation

# DB Scaling
 - Vertical
   - Hardware limit
   - SPOF
   - Expensive
 - Horizontal: sharding
   - Choice of sharding key
   - Challenges
     - Resharding data: consistent hashing
     - Celebrity problem: excessive access to a specific shard
     - Join / de-normalization:n
