# Ch 3. A framework for system design interviews

### Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope

- think deeply and ask questions to clarity requirements and assumptions instead of giving an answer quickly.
- Questions to help you get started
    - What specific features are we going to build?
    - How many users does the product have?
    - How fast does the company anticipate to scale up? What are the anticipated scales in 3 months, 6 months, and a year?
    - What is the companyâ€™s technology stack?

### Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in

- Come up with an initial blueprint for the design. Ask for feedback. Treat your interviewer as a teammate and work together.
- Draw box diagrams with key components on the whiteboard or paper.
- Do back-of-the-envelope calculations to evaluate. Think out loud

### Step 3 - Design deep dive

- identify and prioritize components in the architecture.

### Step 4 - Wrap up

- Discuss potential improvements and identify the system bottlenecks. Never say your design is perfect and nothing can be improved.
- It could be useful to give the interviewer a recap of your design
- Error cases are interesting to talk about
- Operation issues are worth mentioning.
- How to handle the next scale curve is also an interesting topic.
- Propose other refinements you need if you had more time

### Dos

- Always ask for clarification
- Understand the requirements of the problem
- There is neither the right answer nor the best answer.
- Let the interviewer know what you are thinking
- Suggest multiple approaches if possible
- Design the most critical components first
- Never give up

### Don'ts

- Don't be unprepared for typical interview questions.
- Don't jump into a solution without clarifying the requirements and assumptions
- Don't go into too much detail on a single component in the beginning.
- If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for hints
- Again, communication
- Don't think your interview is done once you give the design
