# Coconuts Don't Cut It
### Short Story of native islanders
- Strangers came island with airplane and material wealth
- Strangers provided these things in return for use of their land.
- One day it was over and they all left, taking their strange riches with them.
- The islanders tried to resotre thoese and rebuilt a facsimile of the aip port, control tower and equipment using local materials: vine, coconut shells, palm fronds and such
- They had imitated the form, but not the content, it is called a cargo cult

> All too often, *we* are the islanders.   

### Cargo Cult Trap
- It's easy and tempting to fall into the cargo cult trap: by investing in and buliding up the easily-visible artifacts
- Teams that claim to be using Scrum
  - Daily stand up meeting once a week
  - Six or eight week iteration rather than four week iteration
  - They felt that this was okay because they were using a popular "agile" scheduling tool
- Focusing superficial artifacts
- Incantation : "Stand up" or "iteration" 
- Failed to attact the real magic

## Context Matters
### New methodologies work well for your organization?
- Particular development method / Framework / Testing technique 
- These are actually well-suited for your work?
- Was it adopted just because it was being used by the latest internet-fueled success story?

### New methodologies of big tech and your organization
- Spotify, Netflix Stripe, GitLab and others are success for adopting the plicies and processes
- Each have their own unique take on software development and management
- But are you in the same market? 
  - Same constraints and opportunities
  - Similar expertise, organizations size
  - Similar management
  - Similar culture
  - Similar user base and requirement
- Particular artifacts, superficial structures, policies, processes, and method are not enough

> Tip 87: Do What Works, Not What's Fashionable

### How do you know "what works?" 
- Fundamental of Pragmatic techniques - Try it
- Pilot the idea with a small team
- Keep the good bits that seems to work well
- Discard anything else as waste or overhead
- Spotify or Netflix
  - They didn't follow their current processes while they were growing
  - Years from now, as those companies mature and pivot and continue to thrive, they'll be doing something different yet again
  - That's the actual secret to their success

## One Size Fits no onc well
- The purpose of a software development methodology is to help people work together
- No single plan you can follow when you develop software
- Many certification program
  - Predict on the student being able to memorize and follow the rules
  
### Ability to see beyond the existing rules
- Very different mindset from "but Scrum/Lean/Kanban/XP/Agile does it this way..."
- Take the best pieces from any particular methoodology and adapt them for use.
- No one size fits all
- Current methods are far from complete, so need to look at more than just one popular method
- Scurm by itself doesn't provide enough guidance at the technical level for teams or at the portfolio/governance level for leadership

## The Real Goal
- The goal isn't to
  - "do Scrum"
  - "do agile"
  - "do Learn"
- The goal is
  - To be in a position to deliver working software that gives the users come new capability at a moment's notice
  - Now, not weeks, months, or years from now.
  - *The continuous delivery*
  - It feels like a lofty, unattainable goal
  - The key is to keep aiming in the right direction
  - Shorten the cycle for delivery, 
  - Make to delivery when the users need it, when it makes business sense to do so.

>Tip 88 : Deliver When Users Need It

## Rock-Solid infrastructure
- In order to move to style of continuous development
- Handled in Next Chapter 51
  - Do development in the main truck of version control system
  - Use techniques such as feature switches to roll out test features to users selectively.
- After that device how to organize the work
  - Beginners might want to start with Scrum for project management
  - Plus the technical practices from eXtreme Programming(XP)
  - More disciplined and experienced teams might look to Kanban and Lean 
- Don't take these word for it, investigate and try these approaches for yourself
  - Be careful
  - Overly investing in any particular methodology can leave you blind to alternatives
