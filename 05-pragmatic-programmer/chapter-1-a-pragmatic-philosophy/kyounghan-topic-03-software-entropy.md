# Software Entropy
## Entropy
### Entropy
A term from physics that refers to the amount of ‘disorder’ in a system. and the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that the entropy in the universe tends toward a maximum.

### Entropy of Software
- Software rot / Technical debt 
- Disorder / unmanaged code
- Spread uncontrollably when it start

### The factors which contribute to software rot
- Psychology, the culture
- Even the best-laid plans and the best people could experience ruin and decay.
- There is a need more than a perfect team to protect projects or software

>When you see the broken window, fix it right now, or do something.

## A broken Window
### A broken window 
- Researchers in the field of crime and urban decay discovered the mechanism, one that very quickly turns a clean building into a smashed an abandoned derelict
- If a single broken window goes unrepaired for a long period of time, it creates a sense of abandonment in the building’s residents. And it would cause other window damage sequentially and also the building itself.

### Hopeless can be contagious
- Like the flu virus, ignoring a clearly broken situation reinforces the idea that perhaps nothing can be fixed, that no one cares, all is doomed.
- All negative thoughts which can spread among team members, creating a vicious spiral. 

## Don’t leave ‘broken windows’ unrepaired
What are the broken windows in software development? - bad designs, wrong decisions or poor code
Fix each one as soon as it is discovered.
If there is no time to fix it, then board it up.
Take some actions to prevent further damage and to show that you’re on top of the situation.

> Do not make a broken window at firstly

### First do no harm
Firemen roll out a mat between the front door and the sources of the fire to protect carpet before they drag their big, dirty hoses to catch the fire.
They had accessed the situation clearly and were confident in their ability to manage the fire, and be careful not to inflict unnecessary damage to the property.

### First do no harm for software
Don’t cause collateral damage just because there’s a crisis of some sort. 
A badly designed piece of code, a poor management decision - is all it takes to start the decline.
It doesn’t matter if the project has been fine up to this point, once a single window is broken, it is easy to turn into a damaged building.
