# Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

## Stone soup story
Soldiers act as a catalyst, bring a synergistic result
Eventually everyone wins

## Emulate the soldiers
### Obstacles that block work from progressing
- ask permission to tackle the whole thing
- delays
- form committees, the budget will need approval, …
- Everyone will guard their down resources
 start-up fatigue

### Acting like soldiers
- Work out what you can reasonably ask for
- Develop it, show people and let them marvel, then say, ‘of course, it would be better if we added…’ 
- Pretend it’s not important
- Sit back and wait for them to start asking you to add the functionality originally wanted.

##  Boiled frog
- It’s often the accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams.
- Systems drift from their specifications feature by feature.
- Patch after patch gets added to a piece of code until there’s nothing of the original left. 

### Different from the broken window issues. 
- Broken Window Theory, people lose the will to fight entropy, since they perceive that no one else cares.
- The flog just doesn’t notice the change
- Keep an eye on the big picture.
- Constantly review what’s happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.
