### The Importance of Data Models in Software Development

#### Introduction

- **Importance of Data Models**: Data models significantly influence how software is written, conceptualized, and solved.
- **Layering of Data Models**: Applications are often built by layering one data model on top of another.

#### Layers of Data Models

1. **Application Layer**:
    - Real-world entities are modeled as objects, data structures, and APIs.
    - Specific to the application being developed.
2. **Storage Layer**:
    - Data structures stored using models like JSON, XML, relational tables, or graphs.
3. **Database Representation**:
    - Data is represented as bytes in memory, on disk, or over a network by database software engineers.
4. **Hardware Representation**:
    - Lowest level where data is represented by electrical currents, pulses of light, magnetic fields, etc.

#### Abstractions and Complexity

- **Hiding Complexity**: Each layer provides a clean data model, hiding the complexity of the layers below it.
- **Effective Collaboration**: Allows different groups (e.g., database engineers and application developers) to work together effectively.

#### Variety and Assumptions of Data Models

- **Different Types**: Each data model has its own assumptions about usage.
- **Ease of Use and Performance**: Some models are easier to use and perform better for certain operations.
- **Effort to Master**: It requires significant effort to master a single data model.

#### Choosing the Right Data Model

- **Profound Effect**: The chosen data model profoundly affects what the software can and cannot do.
- **Appropriateness**: It is crucial to choose a data model that is appropriate for the specific application.

#### Overview of General-purpose Data Models

- **Comparison of Models**: Relational models, document models, and graph-based data models.
- **Query Languages**: Comparison of various query languages and their use cases.

#### Future Content

- **Storage Engines**: Discussion on how these data models are implemented in storage engines.

### Relational Model Versus Document Model

#### The Relational Model

- **History**: Proposed by Edgar Codd in 1970, organizing data into relations (tables) of unordered tuples (rows).
- **Implementation Doubts**: Initially doubted but became dominant by the mid-1980s.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for regular, structured data such as transaction processing and batch processing.

#### The Birth of NoSQL

- **Origins**: Emerged in the 2010s as an alternative to the relational model.
- **Driving Forces**:
    - Scalability needs.
    - Preference for open-source software.
    - Specialized query operations.
    - Desire for dynamic, expressive data models.
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Use of multiple data stores to leverage their respective strengths.

#### The Object-Relational Mismatch

- **Impedance Mismatch**: Difficulty in translating between objects in application code and relational tables.
- **ORM Frameworks**: Tools like Hibernate and ActiveRecord reduce but do not eliminate this mismatch.

### Document Databases

#### Structure and Usage

- **Document-like Structure**: Suitable for one-to-many relationships, self-contained documents, and hierarchical data.
- **JSON Representation**: Example of representing a résumé as a JSON document.
- **Locality and Performance**: Storing entire documents in one place can improve performance but has limitations.

#### Many-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships

- **Duplication and Normalization**: Using unique identifiers and foreign keys for relationships.
- **Joins in Document Databases**: Often weak or emulated in application code.

#### Historical Context

- **IMS and the Hierarchical Model**: Similarities to the JSON model, limitations with many-to-many relationships.
- **Network Model**: Generalization of the hierarchical model, complex access paths, and schema inflexibility.
- **Relational Model Advantages**: Simplified data access, query optimizers, and easier application changes.

### Graph-Like Data Models

#### When to Use Graph Models

- **Highly Interconnected Data**: Suitable for social networks, web graphs, road networks, etc.
- **Vertices and Edges**: Represent entities and relationships with flexible connections.

#### Property Graphs

- **Structure**: Vertices with unique identifiers, properties, and edges with labels and properties.
- **Flexibility**: Great for evolving data structures and complex queries.

#### Cypher Query Language

- **Declarative Queries**: Example queries to illustrate the power and flexibility of Cypher.

#### SPARQL and Triple-Stores

- **Triple-Store Model**: Simple three-part statements (subject, predicate, object).
- **SPARQL Queries**: Concise and powerful for querying RDF data.

### Conclusion

#### Choosing the Right Data Model

- **Impact on Software**: The chosen data model significantly influences software capabilities and performance.
- **Adaptability**: Understanding different models allows for selecting the most appropriate one for specific applications.

#### Future Trends

- **Convergence of Models**: Increasing similarity between relational and document databases, leveraging strengths of both.

#### Final Thoughts

- **Mastery and Flexibility**: Effort to master a data model pays off in terms of application flexibility and performance.
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying updated with advancements in data models and query languages enhances software development practices.
