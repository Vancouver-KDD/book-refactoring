- **Request/Response Systems**:
  - Common in modern data systems (e.g., web servers, databases).
  - Users request information, and the system responds.
  - Focus on quick response time and availability.

- **Types of Systems**:
  - **Services (Online Systems)**:
    - Wait for requests, process them quickly, and respond.
    - Performance is measured by response time and availability.
  - **Batch Processing Systems (Offline Systems)**:
    - Process large datasets in batches, producing output after some time.
    - Jobs run periodically, with performance measured by throughput.
  - **Stream Processing Systems (Near-Real-Time Systems)**:
    - Operate on events shortly after they happen, with lower latency than batch processing.
    - Performance is a mix of throughput and latency.

- **Importance of Batch Processing**:
  - Key to building scalable, reliable, and maintainable applications.
  - Example: MapReduce, used for large-scale processing on commodity hardware.
  - Batch processing is not new; it dates back to early computing with punch card systems.

- **Batch Processing with Unix Tools**:
  - Example: Analyzing web server logs using Unix commands (`awk`, `sort`, `uniq`, etc.).
  - Unix tools allow efficient processing of large datasets by chaining simple commands.

- **Execution Flow Differences**:
  - **In-memory Aggregation**:
    - Efficient for small datasets that fit in memory.
    - Uses hash tables to count occurrences.
  - **Sorting**:
    - Better for larger datasets that don't fit in memory.
    - Uses disk for efficient sorting and merging.

- **Unix Philosophy**:
  - **Modularity**: Each program does one thing well.
  - **Composability**: Programs can be connected through standard interfaces like pipes.
  - **Uniform Interface**: ASCII text as a common format for input/output, facilitating interoperability.
  - **Separation of Logic and Wiring**: Use of standard input/output to separate data processing logic from how data flows through the system.

- **Impact of Unix Philosophy**:
  - Encourages rapid prototyping, automation, and experimentation.
  - Remains relevant and influential in modern software development (e.g., Agile, DevOps).
  - Despite its simplicity, Unix's approach to system design and data processing remains a model for effective software development.


## MapReduce and Distributed Filesystems

**MapReduce**

* **Similar to Unix tools:** Processes data in a distributed fashion across many machines.
* **Processes data in stages:** 
    * **Map:** Extracts key-value pairs from each record.
    * **Sort:** Sorts key-value pairs by key.
    * **Reduce:** Processes records with the same key and outputs final results.
* **Benefits:**
    * Parallelization: Processes data concurrently across multiple machines.
    * Scalability: Handles large datasets efficiently.
    * Fault tolerance: Can recover from machine failures.

**Distributed Filesystems**

* **Stores data across multiple machines:** Provides a single, unified view of storage.
* **Examples:** HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), GlusterFS, Amazon S3.
* **Benefits:**
    * Scalability: Can store massive amounts of data.
    * Cost-effectiveness: Utilizes commodity hardware.
    * Fault tolerance: Replicates data for redundancy.

**HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System):**

* **Open-source implementation of Google File System (GFS).**
* **Shared-nothing architecture:** Uses commodity hardware without special storage appliances.
* **Data replication:** Stores multiple copies of data for fault tolerance.
* **Scalability:** Can handle petabytes of data on thousands of machines.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Partitioning:** Divides data into smaller chunks for parallel processing.
* **Shuffle:** The process of moving and sorting data between map and reduce tasks.
* **Join:** Combines data from multiple sources based on a shared key.
* **Grouping:** Aggregates data based on a common attribute (e.g., counting occurrences).
* **Skew:** Uneven distribution of data, where certain keys have significantly more records.

**Additional Notes:**

* MapReduce workflows often involve chaining multiple jobs together.
* Higher-level tools like Pig and Hive simplify MapReduce development.
* MapReduce is well-suited for batch processing, not real-time data analysis.

## Beyond MapReduce

**Materialization of Intermediate State**

* MapReduce fully materializes intermediate state to files, which can be inefficient for complex workflows.
* Dataflow engines avoid materialization for intermediate state, reducing overhead and improving performance.
* Dataflow engines use pipelined execution to process data incrementally, avoiding unnecessary delays.

**Graphs and Iterative Processing**

* Graph processing involves analyzing graphs for patterns and insights.
* Pregel model is a common approach for distributed graph processing.
* Pregel uses message passing and iteration for processing graphs.
* Fault tolerance is achieved through checkpointing and recomputation.
* Graph algorithms often have communication overhead and may benefit from single-machine processing for smaller datasets.

**High-Level APIs and Languages**

* Higher-level languages and APIs simplify MapReduce programming.
* Declarative query languages provide a more abstract way to express computations.
* Dataflow engines incorporate declarative features for improved performance.
* Specialized libraries for specific domains (e.g., machine learning, spatial algorithms) enhance batch processing capabilities.

**Summary**

* Batch processing involves processing large datasets in batches.
* MapReduce is a foundational framework for distributed batch processing.
* Dataflow engines offer improvements in performance, flexibility, and ease of use.
* Key concepts include partitioning, fault tolerance, join algorithms, and high-level APIs.
* Batch processing frameworks are evolving to meet the needs of diverse data processing domains.
