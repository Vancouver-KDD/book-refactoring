# Applications that Use Linearizability

Linearizability is a strong consistency guarantee used in distributed systems to ensure that operations appear to occur instantaneously and in a consistent order. Here are some applications and systems that use linearizability:

## 1. Databases and Distributed Storage Systems
- **Google Spanner**: Google Spanner provides globally distributed, strongly consistent transactions, ensuring linearizability across data centers using the TrueTime API.
- **Amazon DynamoDB (Strongly Consistent Reads)**: DynamoDB offers an option for strongly consistent reads, which guarantees linearizability, ensuring that a read operation always returns the most recent write.
- **CockroachDB**: CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database that provides linearizable transactions, ensuring that all operations appear in a single, global order.

## 2. Distributed Coordination Services
- **Apache ZooKeeper**: ZooKeeper is widely used for distributed coordination tasks like leader election and configuration management, offering linearizable reads and writes to maintain consistency across distributed systems.
- **etcd**: Used in Kubernetes and other distributed systems, etcd ensures linearizability for its read and write operations, providing consistent state across distributed components.

## 3. Consensus Algorithms
- **Paxos**: Paxos is a consensus algorithm that ensures linearizability in distributed systems, used in systems like Google Chubby and Microsoft Azure's Cosmos DB.
- **Raft**: Raft is a consensus algorithm that provides linearizability and is used in distributed systems like etcd, Consul, and others requiring reliable consensus and coordination.

## 4. Replicated State Machines
- **Chubby**: Google's distributed lock service, Chubby, relies on linearizability to ensure consistent lock operations across distributed nodes.
- **Multi-Paxos**: In systems using Multi-Paxos, such as Google Spanner, linearizability is used to maintain consistent state across replicas in distributed systems.

## 5. Messaging Systems
- **Apache Kafka (with strong consistency settings)**: Kafka, when configured with settings like "min.insync.replicas" and "acks=all," can provide linearizability for producing messages, ensuring consistent message delivery order across consumers.
  
## 6. Locking and Synchronization Services
- **Amazon DynamoDB with DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)**: DynamoDB with DAX can be configured to provide linearizable reads, useful for synchronized access to distributed data.
- **Hazelcast**: Hazelcast, an in-memory data grid, offers linearizability for distributed data structures like maps, queues, and locks, ensuring atomic and consistent operations.

## 7. Distributed File Systems
- **Ceph (RADOS Gateway)**: Ceph ensures linearizability for object operations in its RADOS Gateway, providing strong consistency for object storage across distributed nodes.

## 8. Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies
- **Hyperledger Fabric**: Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain framework, uses linearizable transaction processing to ensure consistent and correct order of operations across the network.

## 9. Kubernetes
- **Kubernetes API Server**: The Kubernetes API server uses etcd as its backing store, which provides linearizability for operations like pod scheduling, deployments, and service discovery, ensuring consistent state across the cluster.

## Summary
Linearizability is essential in applications where consistency, correctness, and immediate visibility of operations are critical. These systems typically involve distributed components that must maintain a coherent and up-to-date state across different nodes or data centers, ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience. 



# General Estimates of Time Difference When Using Linearizability

Hereâ€™s a general estimate of the time difference when using linearizability compared to not using it, based on typical scenarios:

## 1. Single Data Center (Local Operations)
- **Linearizable Operations**:
  - **Time**: 1-5 milliseconds per operation.
  - **Reason**: Ensuring linearizability within a single data center typically involves a few network hops and possibly some disk I/O to synchronize state across nodes.
- **Non-Linearizable Operations**:
  - **Time**: 0.1-1 millisecond per operation.
  - **Reason**: Operations can be completed more quickly as they might only require local reads/writes without waiting for global synchronization.

**Difference**: **1-4 milliseconds** additional latency for linearizable operations.

## 2. Cross Data Center (Geographically Distributed)
- **Linearizable Operations**:
  - **Time**: 50-200 milliseconds per operation.
  - **Reason**: Synchronizing state across geographically distant data centers requires multiple network round-trips and coordination, especially in systems like Google Spanner.
- **Non-Linearizable Operations**:
  - **Time**: 5-20 milliseconds per operation.
  - **Reason**: Operations might be completed locally or with minimal synchronization, avoiding the need for global consensus.

**Difference**: **45-180 milliseconds** additional latency for linearizable operations.

## 3. Cloud Services (e.g., AWS, GCP)
- **Linearizable Operations (e.g., DynamoDB with Strongly Consistent Reads)**:
  - **Time**: 5-20 milliseconds per operation.
  - **Reason**: Ensuring a linearizable read or write across replicas adds some latency due to synchronization.
- **Non-Linearizable Operations (e.g., DynamoDB with Eventually Consistent Reads)**:
  - **Time**: 1-5 milliseconds per operation.
  - **Reason**: Operations can be faster as they might return data from the nearest replica without waiting for global synchronization.

**Difference**: **4-15 milliseconds** additional latency for linearizable operations.

## 4. Consensus-Based Systems (e.g., Paxos, Raft)
- **Linearizable Operations**:
  - **Time**: 10-50 milliseconds per operation.
  - **Reason**: Achieving consensus in distributed systems requires multiple nodes to agree on the operation order, which adds latency.
- **Non-Linearizable Operations**:
  - **Time**: 1-5 milliseconds per operation.
  - **Reason**: Without the need for global consensus, operations can be processed quickly, often from local data.

**Difference**: **9-45 milliseconds** additional latency for linearizable operations.

## Summary
- **Single Data Center**: Expect an additional **1-4 milliseconds** of latency for linearizable operations.
- **Cross Data Center**: Expect an additional **45-180 milliseconds** of latency for linearizable operations.
- **Cloud Services**: Expect an additional **4-15 milliseconds** of latency for linearizable operations.
- **Consensus-Based Systems**: Expect an additional **9-45 milliseconds** of latency for linearizable operations.

These estimates provide a general sense of the overhead associated with linearizability. The actual numbers can vary depending on the specific implementation and network conditions.
